How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It pinpointed the precise line where the bug was introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would allow easy acess to different versions of the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: commits make logical sense; Cons: commits are subject to humanity.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that logical changes that span files may be committed together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By seeing all the commits and file differences between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I'll be able to get back to a working commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use git for my android projects.
