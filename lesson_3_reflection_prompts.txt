When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?

   When working with multiple people; when working on multiple computers; to use GitHub's data security to avoid my own backups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   So that local changes don't get stomped.
