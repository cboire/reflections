When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?

   When working with multiple people; when working on multiple computers; to use GitHub's data security to avoid my own backups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   So that local changes don't get stomped.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

   A fork is a copy on GitHub of another GitHub repository.  A clone is a local copy of a git repository which is either local or remote.  A branch is a named commit and may be local or remote.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

   It allows for offline diffs.
